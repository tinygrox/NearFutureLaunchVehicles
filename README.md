## Features

This mod features a number of useful parts, mostly focused on very large launch vehicles.

* **5.0m Parts:** a balanced and extensive part set that provides a new size of rocket parts. Comes with tanks, cargo pieces, adapters, utility parts and specialized components for engine clustering.
* **7.5m Parts:** an extra-large set of rocket parts for those huge constructions. Includes adapters, cargo bays, clustering and utility parts.
* **Advanced Engines:** several new rocket booster engines in 0.625 to 3.75m sizes that push the LFO performance envelope and are great for clustering
* **Support Parts:** new supporting parts that help enhance the large rocket experience, like heavy RCS thrusters and big decouplers

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [ModuleManager (4.1.4)](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)
* [B9PartSwitch (2.17.0)](https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9PartSwitch)
* [DeployableEngines (1.2.2)](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/DeployableEngines)

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## External Mod Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* [KSP-AVC](https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KSPAddonVersionChecker): Provides version checking
* [Community Tech Tree](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CommunityTechTree): Provides an expanded, community-sourced technology tree for modders to use
* ASET Props: If ASET Props and RPM are installed, certain command pods will have RPM layouts
* Connected Living Spaces: Correctly marks parts as passable or impassable
* CryoTanks: Allows storage of cryogenic fuels if CryoTanks is installed. In addition, some RCS blocks will get LH2/O variants
* Real Fuels: Support for RealFuels fuel types
* Modular Fuel Tanks: Support for storing any fuel in MFT tanks

Note that the vast majority of this compatibility is community-sourced and not maintained by me.

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
